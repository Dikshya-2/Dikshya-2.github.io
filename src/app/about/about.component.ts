    <p>I am a 33-year-old programming student at TEC with experience in both web and mobile application development. I have developed mobile applications using Java in Android Studio and created web applications using .NET for the backend and Angular for the frontend. With a bachelor's degree in public health focused on biostatistics and epidemiology, I bring strong analytical skills to my programming journey.</p>

    <p>Recently, I developed a full-stack web application independently, implementing secure login using ASP.NET Identity, along with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using SMTP email confirmation and Google Authenticator. I applied Agile methodology, breaking the project into five structured development phases to ensure focus, progress tracking, and continuous improvement.</p>

    <p>I am currently preparing for my final exam in February 2026 and will complete my education in May 2026. I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and continue learning alongside experienced developers.</p>

    <p>I am ambitious and passionate about technology, programming, and problem-solving, and I'm committed to building smart, user-friendly applications that solve real challenges.</p>
